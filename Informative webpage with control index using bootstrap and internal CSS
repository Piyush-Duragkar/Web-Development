                    <p>
                    <p>The wolf, also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf, is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America.
                         More than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized, and gray wolves, as popularly understood, comprise wild subspecies.
                          The wolf is the largest extant member of the family Canidae.
                          It is also distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail.
                           The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis species, such as the coyote and the golden jackal,
                            to produce fertile hybrids with them. The banded fur of a wolf is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black,
                             although subspecies in the arctic region may be nearly all white.

                        <p>The wolf is the largest extant member of the Canidae family, and is further distinguished from coyotes and jackals by a broader snout,
                             shorter ears, a shorter torso and a longer tail. It is slender and powerfully built, with a large, deeply descending rib cage,
                              a sloping back, and a heavily muscled neck. The wolf's legs are moderately longer than those of other canids, which enables
                               the animal to move swiftly, and to overcome the deep snow that covers most of its geographical range in winter.
                                The ears are relatively small and triangular. The wolf's head is large and heavy, with a wide forehead, strong jaws and a long,
                                 blunt muzzle. The skull is 230–280 mm (9–11 in) in length and 130–150 mm (5–6 in) in width. The teeth are heavy and large,
                                  making them better suited to crushing bone than those of other canids. They are not as specialized as those found in hyenas though.
                                   Its molars have a flat chewing surface, but not to the same extent as the coyote, whose diet contains more vegetable matter.
                                   Females tend to have narrower muzzles and foreheads, thinner necks, slightly shorter legs, and less massive shoulders than males.</p>

                        <p>The phylogenetic descent of the extant wolf C. lupus from C. etruscus through C. mosbachensis is widely accepted.
                             The earliest fossils of C. lupus were found in what was once eastern Beringia at Old Crow, Yukon, Canada, and at Cripple Creek Sump,
                              Fairbanks, Alaska. The age is not agreed upon but could date to one million years ago.
                               Considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves by the Late Pleistocene. They had more robust skulls and teeth than modern wolves,
                                often with a shortened snout, a pronounced development of the temporalis muscle, and robust premolars.
                                 It is proposed that these features were specialized adaptations for the processing of carcass and bone associated with the
                                  hunting and scavenging of Pleistocene megafauna. Compared with modern wolves, some Pleistocene wolves showed an increase in tooth breakage
                                   similar to that seen in the extinct dire wolf. This suggests they either often processed carcasses, or that they competed with other
                                    carnivores and needed to consume their prey quickly. Compared with those found in the modern spotted hyena, the frequency and location of
                                     tooth fractures in these wolves indicates they were habitual bone crackers.</p>
                        <p>Genomic studies suggest modern wolves and dogs descend from a common ancestral wolf population that existed 20,000 years ago.
                             A 2021 study found that the Himalayan wolf and the Indian plains wolf are part of a lineage that is basal to other wolves and split from
                              them 200,000 years ago. Other wolves appear to have originated in Beringia in an expansion that was driven by the huge ecological
                               changes during the close of the Late Pleistocene. A study in 2016 indicates that a population bottleneck was followed by a rapid
                                radiation from an ancestral population at a time during, or just after, the Last Glacial Maximum. This implies the original
                                 morphologically diverse wolf populations were out-competed and replaced by more modern wolves.</p>
                        <p>A 2016 genomic study suggests that Old World and New World wolves split around 12,500 years ago followed by the divergence
                             of the lineage that led to dogs from other Old World wolves around 11,100–12,300 years ago. An extinct Late Pleistocene
                              wolf may have been the ancestor of the dog, with the dog's similarity to the extant wolf being the result of genetic
                               admixture between the two. The dingo, Basenji, Tibetan Mastiff and Chinese indigenous breeds are basal members of the domestic
                                dog clade. The divergence time for wolves in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia is estimated to be fairly recent at around 1,600 years ago.
                                 Among New World wolves, the Mexican wolf diverged around 5,400 years ago.</p>
